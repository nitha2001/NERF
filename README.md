# Neural_Representations_for_Scene_Fitting_and_Novel_View_Synthesis
This repository contains the implementation for my final project in the course CIS 580: Machine Perception. The project explores Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and positional encoding techniques to achieve 2D image fitting and 3D scene reconstruction, as well as synthesizing novel views using neural networks.
